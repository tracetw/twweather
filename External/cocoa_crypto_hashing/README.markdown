CocoaCryptoHashing
==================

About
-----

CocoaCryptoHashing is a very simple and lightweight collection of MD5/SHA1
functions for Cocoa (which sadly does not contain any of these by default). It
provides two categories on both `NSString` and `NSData`. The header file is
pretty well documented, so getting started should not be a problem.

Requirements
------------

You will need Cocoa (and more specifically, Foundation), in order to use
this. OpenSSL is required as well, but since Mac OS X comes with it by
default, this should not be a problem.

Building
--------

Depending on the platform and the target, you may need different linker flags.
On 10.5 and on the iPhone platform, `-lcrypto` should be enough; on 10.4 you
may need to use both `-lcrypto` and `-lssl`.

License
-------

CocoaCryptoHashing is licensed under the modified BSD license. This license is
included in the COPYING file.
